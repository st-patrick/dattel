	<h3>Hot Tips</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Keep your camera off when no one is in your room. Talk for 1 or 2 minutes first, then turn on the camera after.</li>
		<li>If you use any video meeting service, check what name appears for you. You might not want to let everyone know your full name.</li>
		<li>Under location, list the nearest larger cities you would be ok meeting in, e.g. "Los Angeles, San Diego". If they are small, don't worry about it, so long as it represents your preferences.</li>
		<li>With the whole video thing, we can make sure you are talking to real people. Now those people might still be lying but hey, at least they have a beating heart.</li>

		/post
		/get

	/communities
		/post
		/getAll
		/{ID}
			/getAds
			
			
			
and then, of course if the communities are just tags, then any post with any tag creates new communities
But lets just start with like... 50 basic communities and let people pick between 1 and 10 they want to belong to

And also, posts should auto-delete after... like idk. 30 mins or so.

for now, text intros.
later on, have people hold the peace gesture into the camera so as to obscur facial recognition and have that be profile pic

have a "police" section, where people can captcha-like help detect fake accounts or mostly anonymous accounts that are not backed by any real intent to talk
			
the beauty of this is you can either be "passive" and wait for people to join your room OR browse around people's rooms.

... obviously rather quickly we will need things like "gender" and "location"

put it behind cloudflare to prevent yadda... VPN, bots etc...
